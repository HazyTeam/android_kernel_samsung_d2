+ * to fixup or reject the mode prior to trying to set it. This is an internal
+ * helper that drivers could e.g. use to update properties that require the
+ * entire output pipe to be disabled and re-enabled in a new configuration. For
+ * example for changing whether audio is enabled on a hdmi link or for changing
+ * panel fitter or dither attributes. It is also called by the

  * RETURNS:
  * True if the mode was set successfully, or false otherwise.
