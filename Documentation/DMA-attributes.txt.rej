+DMA_ATTR_FORCE_CONTIGUOUS
+-------------------------
+
+By default DMA-mapping subsystem is allowed to assemble the buffer
+allocated by dma_alloc_attrs() function from individual pages if it can
+be mapped as contiguous chunk into device dma address space. By
+specifing this attribute the allocated buffer is forced to be contiguous
+also in physical memory.
